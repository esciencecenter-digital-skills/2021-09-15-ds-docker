This workshop aims to introduce the use of Docker containers (and similar technology).
Containers can help to make research more reproducible. Within a Docker container, software
becomes instantly accessible to potential users without going through pages of install
instructions or days of compiling decade-old Fortran programs. This means that your research
software can continue to be accessible for years to come.

Specifically, containers allow a researcher to package up a project with all of the parts it
needs - such as libraries, dependencies, and system settings - and ship it all out as one
package. Anyone can then open up a container and work within it, viewing and interacting with
the project as if the machine they are accessing it from is identical to the machine specified
in the container - regardless of what their computational environment actually is. They are
designed to make it easier to transfer projects between very different environments.

The workshop will introduce the basics of running software with Docker and teach you how you can
use containers to make your research software more reusable and reproducible.
