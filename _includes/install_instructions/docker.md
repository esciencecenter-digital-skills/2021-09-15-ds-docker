### Docker
- Docker is the main focus of this workshop. Please follow the [Install instructions on the Docker
homepage.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Have an account on both [Github](https://github.ocm) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com). We
  will use the Docker Hub to download pre-built container images, and for you to upload and download
  container images that you create, as explained in the relevant lesson episodes.
- Download the [docker-intro.zip](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/docker-introduction/files/docker-intro.zip)
  file. Move the downloaded file to your Desktop and unzip it. It should unzip to a folder called
  `docker-intro`.
